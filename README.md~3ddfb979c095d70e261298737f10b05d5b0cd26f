# Liver Disease Prediction

This project is a **Liver Disease Prediction System** built using machine learning models and deployed using Flask. It helps in predicting whether a patient is likely to have liver disease based on several medical parameters.

##  Dataset Information
- **Source:** [Indian Liver Patient Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records)
- **Total Samples:** 583
- **Features:** Age, Gender, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphotase, Alamine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, Total Proteins, Albumin, Albumin and Globulin Ratio
- **Target:** Disease Present (1) or Not (0)

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & Numpy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA)

##  How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vijay994/Liver_Disease_Predictions.git
    cd Liver_Disease_Predictions
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app/app.py
    ```
4. Open your browser and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:5000
    ```

##  How It Works
- Upload patient data (CSV file) or manually enter the values.
- Click on "Predict" button.
- The model will predict whether liver disease is present or not.
- The result page will show the prediction along with the model used.



##  Future Scope
- Add more advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM.
- Deploy the app on Render or Heroku.
- Improve the user interface using Bootstrap.
