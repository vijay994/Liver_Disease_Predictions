# ü©∫ Liver Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## üìå Project Objective
The goal of this project is to **predict whether a patient has liver disease or not** based on clinical data using machine learning classification techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow
### Step 1 - Data Collection
- Downloaded the dataset from UCI Repository.

### Step 2 - Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values.
- Encoded categorical feature ("Gender").
- Scaled numeric data if needed.

### Step 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plotted distributions, pair plots, and heatmaps.
- Identified correlations between features.

### Step 4 - Model Building
- Tried multiple classification algorithms:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest ‚úÖ (Best performing model)
    - KNN
    - SVM

### Step 5 - Model Evaluation
- Compared Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Best Model:** Random Forest
- **Accuracy:** 77.85%

### Step 6 - Prediction System (Flask App)
- Built a web form where user can input patient details.
- Backend loads `random_forest_model.pkl` and `imputer.pkl` for preprocessing and prediction.
- Prediction result is shown on a new page.
